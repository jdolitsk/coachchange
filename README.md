# Mid-Season and Off-Season NBA Coaching Changes Effect on Team and Player Success
Every season, teams are expected to perform in a certain way, and if a team underperforms expectations, changes are bound to be made. A coach is often blamed for a team underperforming, since they are the leader of the team, so this paper aims to test whether that it was the right decision to change the coach. If it is found that there is a significant change in team performance, then it can lead more teams to change their coach, rather than dismantle the team roster. It is also important to measure how it affects the star player on the team. If the star player is underperforming or is unhappy, it can lead the entire team to be derailed. This [paper](https://github.com/jdolitsk/coachchange/blob/main/paper.pdf) will take a look at the impact of changing a coach in the NBA has on team success, and player performance. Overall, I found that that changing a coach has some impact on team success, but in totality, that effect is not large enough to justify how often coaches are changed.
